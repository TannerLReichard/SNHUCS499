      <h3>Self Assessment</h3>
      <p> In my academic career towards achieving this bachelor's in computer science, I have shown drastic and marked talent and greater ability in applying myself to learning and adapting to many new languages and skill subsets. Through my work, you can see that regardless of what problem is presented in front of me, I can quickly break things down into manageable steps and formulate a realistic plan towards solving it. </p>
      <p> In this project, I've successfully translated a fullstack web application into another, along with complex functionality as well as having a distinct attention to detail with polish and applying myself to build a product I can be proud of within the time constraints. </p>
      <p> With my work in my career as well as in school, I’ve worked with a wide variety of people and always take point in helping everyone whenever I can. I’ve always been described as someone easy to get along with, and having my upbeat attitude be a huge benefit to the morale of a team, with one coworker declaring if I wasn’t the face of a project along with my huge contributions to the team, it would have failed completely. My adeptness with communication, before verbal and written, are great to have, being able to spot pitfalls in problem comprehension and lapses of coverage in planned solutions. My abilities with data structures and algorithms can provide huge levels of efficiency, saving projects processing space and time. My software engineering skills show a near perfect accuracy in deducing optimal solutions and realistic ways in which they can be achieved. Plus, with keeping security in mind from the beginning of planning stages, I show a commitment to keeping company as well as customer data secure and flaws in the program to be as covered as possible. </p>
      <p> This project as well as my whole portfolio show a commitment and love towards the whole field of computer science. I love a challenge and enjoy programming and have spent my life improving myself bit by bit. Through this project, you will see any obstacle I face, I can hurdle over it, or if it’s too tall to jump, I can think of a clever way around. </p>

      <h3>Enhancement 1 Narrative</h3>
      <p> For this milestone, I’ve recreated the functionality of the Travlr Getaways fullstack MEAN application in the PostegreSQL, Express, React, and Node.js (PERN) stack. I chose this artifact for its complexity and its potential to be iterated on to showcase the skills I’ve attained through my work towards acquiringmy bachelors in Computer Science. With a fullstack application showing a well-roundedness with work in both backend processes and frontend functionality, plus the overall size of the project compared to the smaller and simpler projects in other classes, I thought this would be a suitably challenging and impressive artifact to improve. </p>
      <p> For this milestone, I have applied myself by recreating the functionality of the fullstack application, but with using the PERN stack. This shows a fluid and dynamic understanding of processes so that they can be translated into any language, and shows a high level of critical understanding of structuring software engineering and design. </p>
      <p> I believe I’ve met several course outcomes through this milestone, including employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science, designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts through my ample usage of formatting best practices and ample amounts of comments explaining each section of the code in practical terms. I also met the outcome of demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals through my use of modern databases and application solutions.  </p>
      <p> As a reflection, this is quite stressful trying to get working since by the nature of the project, I would finish the databases enhancement first, then the data structures, then this one. I’ve hustled quite a bit, and I’ve made some decisive cut corners such as consolidating the customer page and the admin page into one, skipping the log in and security functionality to finish with the databases milestone, and the severe lack of any formatting aside from throwing the original’s css in and having whatever populate happen currently. I’ve learned a lot about how react works, and other functionalities including Neon, Zustand, and Vite. This was an excellent learning experience and I will learn even more taking a post-mortem look after the project is over. </p>

      <h3>Enhancement 2 Narrative</h3>
      <p>For this milestone, I’ve added logic into my newly recreated Travlr Getaways fullstack web application to include a dropdown menu that uses a linked list and a merged sort algorithm to sort the available trips by fields such as start date, end date, and price. This includes some new files under a new backend\utils folder including LinkedList.js to define the nodes, and LinkedListSortingAlgs for the sorting logic. UseTripStore’s fetchTrips logic was updated to pass in the dropdown’s value to the api url, tripController’s getAllTrips was updated to perform the sorting and return the final dataset, and Homepage’s HTML was updated to include the dropdown for the user to select. </p>
      <p> As a common accessibility feature with many sites, it made sense to include while also being a practical way of meeting the enhancement’s requirements despite the application using postgreSQL, which isn’t easily application to the usage of algorithms. The inclusion of this covers a very succinct and clear logic, showcasing my ability to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science, and to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by my usage of merge sorting the fields into a linked list for easy sorting. This could easily be expanded to other fields and helps both the client and their customers find trips. </p>
      <p> During the process I was mentally thinking it would take as much time and effort as the first enhancement, which in hindsight didn’t make sense since that was building an entire application versus adding functionality to that application. However, my data structures and algorithms class was a few years ago now, so I did need to refresh my memory of it, but that was always pretty straightforward for me so it didn’t cause many issues. </p>

      <h3>Enhancement 3 Narrative</h3>
      <p>For this milestone, I’ve used a postgreSQL database as the host for the data, rather than the MongoDB database collections in my original artifact. I’ve separated the trip information into two tables for organizational purposes, as well as given them better data types for data analysis and sorting purposes. I also created a view that joins them for ease of access within the application, and included useful fields such as the length column which automatically calculates the length between the start and end date of the trip. </p>
      <p> I also am storing the user log in information in this database, with their id, email, and password (encrypted for security best practices) for the application to reference when logging users in. </p>
      <p> The sqlConn database connection variable in the tripsController.js file in the backend contains the database calls, and uses prepared statements to avoid potential SQL injections by default with how neon is set up. The tripsRoutes.js file also in the backend shows the functions for editting and creating trips are utilizing the verifyToken function to prevent them from being used if the user isn’t logged in. </p>
      <p> I’ve included this as part of my enhancements because it handily shows an equal but better formatted and secured version of database storage than in my original artifact. Setting up the database with secured calls to get information from it shows my ability to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals through the setup of this database along with its security features, as well as develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by using modern databases with built in security, as well as applying a standard security layer to keep non-admins from modifying or adding trip data should the site go live. </p>
      <p> Overall this enhancement was doable but some extenuating circumstances made it quite difficult to finish quickly. Using bcrypt to store encrypted passwords and compare them when the user is logging in was deceptively easy, and if I had more time I would’ve liked to delve further into what the standard is like in the industry today both for smaller scale apps an the behemoths. My biggest challenge was the time crunch, I usually do have some things come up in my classes but this final class the universe seems hell-bent on making sure I can’t finish things quickly. </p>
